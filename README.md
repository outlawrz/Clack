Report:
When a negative value is put in for the port number then the hash code is 0. This may be solved by taking the absolute value of the port number at the beginning of my hash value function.
When the username is null, the compiler has an error because my hash code function points to a null reference. This can be solved by checking for a null username within my hash code function.
